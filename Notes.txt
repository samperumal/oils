inconsistent number locations
gist: oil well metaphor, not very effective or apparent
colors for categories of information (oil like colours), luminance contrast (and works in b&w), 
	but yellow on white translates to light grey on white, neither of which are ideal
	Brightness contrast less effective for cooler oils
consistent font used for oil sub-types, but actual oil type in different fonts
	same oil type in different locations hides fact that sub-types can matter (since sub type is visually first)
	inconsistent fonts (Sunflower vs Olive)
	lots of distracting visual pop out
	luminance is a stronger channel than font (pattern), hence gestalt similarity is undermined (e.g. Sunflower)
small color scale helps make categories easily distinguishable, allows grouping of related
red-green colorblind issues
luminance channel used for both taste strength and temperature category
use of dotted lines overloaded for both averages and breakout information - visual conjunction
use of smoke point for ordering, but distance from data hides relationship, and implies oils are ordered on health as that is the primary visual query
	- position bars centrally as they are the most import element
ratios require counting, difficult to compare, unnecessary , not explained
no patterns
	- clean, but misses opportunity to use a channel 
lower = better intuitively difficult apply when surrounded by higher = better data,
	also difficult to locate. Further, what does no bar mean? see fish oil


poor continuity of objects due to spaces

gestalt laws
high/low = good/bad inconsistently used 
	
poor use of font, no legend, adds busyness		
no description



colors only for a single category breakout


lower saturated oils better in general, then consider omega 3 to omega 6 ratio

Visual queries
* Which oils are healthiest
* Which oils should I generally avoid
* Which oils should I replace them with
* For my given purpose, which oil is best suited
 - Current layout assumes purpose is more important than health benefits, despite the opposite being more likely
* Taste vs health
 - Are there strong tasting, healthy oils that can be used for deep frying
* Which is the most cost effective healthy oil to use for my family 
 
Vertical stacked lines/bars, 
	- vernier acuity to indicate proportion of omega 3 as offset/partial fill on log scale (necessary because of length of oil list)
		> use angle of line
	- position bars centrally as they are the most import element
	- pattern bars
	
 - allows simple comparisons between related areas
 - order by health benefits
 - number summaries before bars
 - icons for smoke point and uses (find sauteeing, etc), ideally with different closed contouring (gestalt)
 
Use background colour blocks to group related elements (bars, icons, etc.)
 
3 fonts for taste profile
